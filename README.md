# 🧮 Basic Calculator in Python

This is a simple Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — based on user input.

## 📌 Features
- Accepts two numbers from the user.
- Allows the user to choose an operation (+, -, *, /).
- Displays the result in a clear format.
- Handles division by zero gracefully.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter:
   - The first number
   - The second number
   - The operation they want to perform
2. It calculates the result.
3. It prints the calculation and the result to the screen.

## 💻 Example
```bash
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): +
10 + 5 = 15
